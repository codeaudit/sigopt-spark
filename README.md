# SigSpark
=========================================
Compiles against the Spark 2.0 build. 


SigSpark integrates SigOpt's functionality into Spark for performing Bayesian optimization over hyperparameters. TIt is designed to automatically run experiments  in a manner that iteratively adjusts parameter values so as to minimize some user-defined objective over a pre-defined state space in as few runs as possible.
